# BreakDownBuddy - On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance

The "On Road Vehicle Breakdown Assistance" project is a mobile application designed to provide quick and efficient assistance to vehicle owners in case of breakdowns, especially in remote locations. The app serves as a bridge between vehicle owners and service providers, ensuring prompt help during critical situations.

## Features

- **EV and ICE Support:** The app caters to both Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles, providing specific assistance and resources for each type.

- **Charging Station Locator:** For EV owners, the app offers a real-time charging station locator, helping them find the nearest charging points when needed.
